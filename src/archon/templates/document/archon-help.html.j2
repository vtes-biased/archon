        </h1>
        <p>
            The Archon is the platform managing both members of the VTES players association, and VTES events
            throughout the world. Vampire: The Eternal Struggle (VTES) is a card game
            produced by Black Chantry Productions (BCP). The VTES players association is known as the VEKN
            (Vampire Elder Kindred Network).
        </p>
        <h2 id="members-and-profile">Members and profile
            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#members-and-profile"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Users who create an account on the Archon have access to limited information: the list of upcoming
            VTES events and a limited list of VEKN representatives known as National Coordinators (NC) and Princes,
            together with their contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be become VEKN member, a user must be sponsored by a VEKN representative so, if you desire to join,
            please reach out to the nearest Prince or NC. VEKN membership is free.
        </p>
        <h3 id="vekn-id-number">VEKN ID Number
            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#vekn-id-number"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Members of the VEKN are attributed a 7-digit VEKN identification number (VEKN# in short) when they join in.
            This number does not change throughout their membership. You'll need a VEKN# to participate to official VEKN
            events, like most VTES tournaments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>New Members</strong> must be sponsored by a Prince or NC, who can attribute them a VEKN#
            after having checked their information and, usually, met them in person.
            Most members simply get sponsored when they join their first event.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Existing Members</strong> logging in on the Archon for the first time need to <em>“claim”</em>
            their VEKN#. Just click on the “<i class="bi bi-person-check"></i>Existing VEKN#” button in your profile,
            and provide your number.

        <h4>Inner Circle (IC / Admin)</h4>
        The Inner Circle is the administrative board of the VEKN, and consists of distinct roles
        determined an appointed by the Chairman. The current Inner Circle is:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chairman: </strong> Hugh Angseesing</li>

            <li><strong>Playtest: </strong> Norman Brown</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>National Coordinator (NC)</h4>
        <p>
            Some places are just so big that they need someone who is devoted to thinking about "National" concerns.
            While princes devote their time to local events, National Coordinators are primarily concerned with
            National Events. They promote the game and are a resource to princes in their geographic area.
        </p>
        <p>
            National coordinators represent their players at an international level.
            Each country should have one National Coordinator. If a country does not have a National Coordinator yet,
            Princes in that country advise the Inner Circle on the appointment.
        </p>
        <p>Responsibilities of a National Coordinator include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Representing their players and Princes, and being available to them as their representative</li>
            <li>Maintaining a national communications platform for VTES players in their country</li>
            <li>Organizing national tournaments and qualifiers, as well as continental championships</li>
            <li>Advising the Inner Circle on organized play</li>
            <li>Translating rules and advertisements</li>
            <li>Appointing Princes</li>
            <li>Making promotional items available to Princes for demos and tournaments</li>
            <li>Promoting VTES to retailers and supporting a good relationship between distributors and retailers</li>
            <li>Sponsoring new VEKN members, registering and protecting their personal information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            They can enlist help from their Princes to care for these Responsibilities as they sit fit,
            with their Princes' accord.
        </p>
        <h4>Prince</h4>
        <p>
            Princes are active VTES players in charge of promoting VTES. They organize regular play in their domain,
            be it weekly gaming events at a store or a public place, or regular online sessions or leagues.
            They actively promote VTES through public demos and tournaments, and coopt new VEKN members.
            They uphold the VEKN tournament rules and rating system, as well as the VEKN Code of Ethics.
        </p>
        <p>A Prince responsibilities include:</p>
        <li>
            Being a contact new players can reach out to when in search for other players, cards to trade,
            or information about VTES.
        </li>
        <li>Representing their players, and being available to them as their representative</li>
        <li>Maintaining an open and welcoming community of VTES players in their area</li>
        <li>Organizing regular open sessions</li>
        <li>Organizing public demos and tournaments in their area, at stores, conventions, or in public places.</li>
        <li>Maintaining and improving relationship with local retailers</li>
        <li>Promoting VTES in every way possible</li>
        <li>Sponsoring new VEKN members, registering and protecting their personal information</li>
        <p>
            A Prince is appointed by the National Coordinator of their country, or a member of the Inner Circle.
            They can enlist voluntary players in their area to support them in their efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Princes have access to exclusive communication channels with other Princes, National Coordinators,
            and the Inner Circle. Their efforts in promoting the game through regular play, demos and tournaments
            constitute the essential core of the VEKN, and what keep the game running and growing.
            They can count on their National Coordinator's help and mentoring in doing so, and can apply for promotional
            support, in the form of cards, bundles and accessories.
        </p>
        <h4>Judges</h4>
        <p>
            Official VEKN Judges are VTES players recognized for their knowledge of the game rules, tournament rules,
            Judges guidelines, and cards rulings. They should be preferred as Judges in VEKN sanctionned tournaments,
            although <em>for now</em>, there is no obligation for a tournament judge to be an official VEKN judge.
            Official Judges make themselves available to events organizers (Princes and NCs) to act as
            tournament judges when needed. Check out the
            <a href="{{ url_for('document_judges_guide') }}">Judges Guide</a> for more information.
        </p>
        <h4>Ethics Commitee</h4>
        <p>
            The VEKN Ethics Committee is appointed by the VEKN Chairman. Its responsibilities and procedures are
            detailed in the <a href="{{ url_for('document_code_of_ethics') }}">VEKN Code of Ethics</a>.

            Users of the Archon can register their personal information, like their name, e-mail,
            various social networks identifiers, as well as the deck lists they use in tournaments.
            This information is made available to VEKN members under conditions detailed below, and users have a right
            to access, modify and delete it as they wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their <strong>name</strong> can be displayed to any Archon user.
            Their rating at official VEKN tournament, specifcally, is public information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their <strong>contact information</strong>, e-mail and social networks identifiers,
            is only accessible to Princes and NCs in their country, except if they're a Prince or NC themselves,
            in which case their contact information is made publicy available as part of their responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>deck lists</strong> of VEKN members, when provided and recorded for an event,
            can be made available to archiving projects and initiatives selected by the
            Inner Circle and run by VEKN members.

            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#registration-check-in"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            VEKN members can register to a tournament from the moment it is published until it is finished.
            This allows organizers to estimate the number of attendees prior to the event.
            Registration stays open throughout an event because some organizers might want to add players
            while an event is running, for example still welcome late comers for the second round.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players can also drop, or be dropped, from the players list at any time. They still appear
            in the list of players for the event to avoid complications and ensure proper tracking.
            However, they will not score any rating nor contribute to the tournament players count
            if they have not played at least one round.
        </p>
        <p>
            To participate in a round, a player needs not only be registered,
            but also to <strong>check in</strong>, or be checked-in by the organizers, just before the round begins.
        </p>
        <h4>Check-In and Barriers</h4>
        <p>
            A player need to be checked-in to participate in an upcoming round. However, there are cases where the
            Archon will not allow for a player to check in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the tournament <strong>requires a decklist</strong> and the player has not uploaded one.
                In that case, organizers need to either ask them to upload their decklist, or relax the requirement
                in the tournament configuration (Info tab).
            </li>
            <li>If the player was <strong>banned</strong> by the VEKN or <strong>disqualified</strong> from the event
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Players self-check-in with QR code</h4>
        <p>
            In smaller events, the organizers can operate the check-in directly as players come in,
            and even use the <em>Check everyone in</em> button after they've reviewed the list of registered players
            and dropped any absentee.
        </p>
        <p>
            In bigger events, though, the check-in desk operation is a time-consuming step that organizers might want
            to accelerate. In that case, they can use the <strong>check-in QR code</strong> to allow players
            to check-in by themselves. The QR code can be displayed as a separate (printable) page before the tournament
            starts, or organizers can simply present this QR code on their own mobile device, for players to scan.
            Players can only scan this QR code from the tournament page: this is not a link, they need to be logged
            in the Archon and have a VEKN#.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the first round is played, the Archon still asks for a check-in on each following round.
            This is a step that should be expedited by clicking the <em>Check everyone in</em> if the round
            is taking place the same day. Organizer should make sure that if any player has left
            the tournament, they have been dropped before proceeding.
        </p>
        <h3 id="round-management">Round management
            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#round-management"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Once a round starts, players are assigned tables and seat and can start a game.
            The round seating can be modified by organizers if needed, for example to add a late joiner
            or remove an absentee. When they are done, players can record their table results.
        </p>
        <h4>Round seating</h4>
        <p>
            The Archon optimizes a round seating in accordance to these VEKN guidelines for preliminary rounds seatings:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group-numbered">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                No pair of players repeat their predator-prey relationship. This is mandatory, by the
                <a href="/document/tournament-rules.html#H3-1-2-preliminary-rounds-seating">VEKN Tournament rules</a>.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">No pair of players share a table through all rounds.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Available VPs are equitably distributed.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">No pair of players share a table more often than necessary.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">A player does not sit in the fifth seat more than once.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">No pair of players repeat the same relative position<sup>*</sup>.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">A player does not play in the same seat position.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Starting transfers are equitably distributed.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">No pair of players repeat the same relative position group<sup>**</sup>.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>* Relative position: </strong> prey, predator, cross-table (4 players),
                grand-prey,
                grand-predator.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>** Relative position group: </strong> Adjacent or non-adjacent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When modifying a round seating, organizers will see a display of rules violations, so they can try and
            keep their modifications optimal. Seatings violating rule 1. will not be accepted.
        </p>
        <h4>Results reports</h4>
        <p>
            Players can report their table results on the tournament page by themselves, while the round is ongoing.
            Organizers and judges can also input and change tables results at any time, after which
            they cannot be modified by players anymore.

            The Archon validates that the result are consistent with the seating and number of players,
            and will not allow a round to finish with incomplete or invalid results.
            Judges can, however, <strong>override</strong> this check in case they are faced with an odd situation:
            for example if they award no VP or only half a VP after a player's urgent departure
            in the middle of a round.

        <p>
            After two preliminary rounds, organizers can either proceed with more rounds, or with a finals.
            The finals will select the top five players in terms of Game win (GW), Victory Points (VP),
            and Tournament Points (TP), as per the
            <a href="/document/tournament-rules.html#H3-7-determining-a-game-winner">VEKN tournament rules</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organizers should make sure all top players are available for the finals, and drop those who cannot attend
            prior to launching the finals in the Archon, so those players can be ignored.
        </p>
        <h4>Toss for finals</h4>
        <p>
            In case of a tie for the top five seats, a random method must be used to break the tie.
            The Archon provides a button to do just that, but the organizers can opt for any other method they see fit,
            and input the results in plain numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.), the lower number being the better score.
        </p>
        <h4>Seating</h4>
        <p>
            Finals follow a specific seating procedure, indicated in the
            <a href="/document/tournament-rules.html#H3-1-3-final-round-seating">VEKN tournament rules</a>.
            Organizers and judges should alter the table seating to reflect the actual seating after this procedure
            has taken place.
        </p>
        <h4>Results and Winner</h4>
        <p>
            Once the finals have been played, organizers can input the results as usual,
            declare a tournament winner, and finish the tournament. Note that winning the tournament finals,
            even with less than 2 Victory Points, counts as a Game Win. All other finalists rank as second,
            regardless of their results.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sanctions">Sanctions
            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#sanctions"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Throughout an event, organizers and judges can sanction players in case of any issue, whether
            they fail to follow the game rules, tournament rules, or ethical requirements of the VEKN.
            Sanctions can be added by clicking the <i class="bi bi-info-circle-fill"></i> button next to
            a players' name anywhere in the console.
        </p>

                <strong>Caution:</strong> Cautions are only tracked during the event.
                They are especially useful during big events so judges can keep a track record of what has been going
                down
                on each table and for each player, even if different judges intervene at different times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Warning:</strong> Warnings are recorded for the event, but also on a player's profile,
                and will be displayed to organizers during future events the player participate in.
                Repeated offenses, even at different events, should be examined by organizers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Disqualification:</strong> Disqualifications immediately drop the player from the tournament
                and prevent them from checking in in further rounds. The attending judge should make sure their table
                result is set to zero for the round, if any round is ongoing. As for warnings, a disqualification
                is recorded on a player's profile and displayed to future events organizers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Although the tournament rules make provisions for a <em>Game Loss</em> penalty, this penalty has been
            deemed too disruptive and impractical to be included in the Archon platform. In practice, organizers are
            advised to opt for a Warning or a Disqualification instead.
            A player should not be barred from a single game, then allowed to play a further round.
