            A spectator of a game is defined as any person other than a

            a spectator for the remainder of the round. All spectators are expected to remain silent during the
            course of a game and are not permitted to communicate with players in any way while a game is in
            progress. Spectators who believe that they have observed rules violations should inform a judge, but
            they must not interfere with the game. Players have the right to request that any spectator not observe
            their game. All such requests must be made through a judge, who may grant or deny the request as he or
            she sees fit. The judge or organizer may choose to prohibit all specatators at any table(s) or round(s)

            Officially sanctioned competition requires the physical
            presence of a head judge during play to adjudicate disputes, interpret rules, assign penalties, and make
            other official decisions. The head judge may, with the tournament organizer's agreement, appoint any
            number of other judges to help in the performance of the head judge's duties and to perform other tasks
            the head judge may require. The head judge is responsible for reporting all warnings issued at the
            tournament to the VEKN either directly or through the tournament organizer's event report.
        </p>
        <p>
            The head judge and the tournament organizer can be, but do not
            have to be, the same individual. The head judge is the final judicial authority at any VEKN-sanctioned
            tournament (see <a href="#H2-5-judge-responsibilities">2.5. Judge Responsibilities</a>).

            The Multi-Judge System may be used at any non-qualifier,
            non-championship tournament with at least eight participants (<i>i.e.</i>, having at least two tables).
            Organizers choosing this system must announce its use before the tournament begins and identify six
            judges as head judge, secondary judge, and third, fourth, fifth, and sixth judge. Organizers should use
            good judgement when selecting the Multi-Judge System and should ensure its use will not disrupt the
            event. Tournament organizers may only participate in events they sanction if they are using the
            Multi-Judge System. These types of events are the only ones in which judges and/or tournament organizers
            are allowed to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using the Multi-Judge System, the head judge makes all
            rulings, except when a decision is needed in a game in which the head judge was seated as a player. If a
            ruling is needed in a head judge's game, the secondary judge makes the call, except in games in which
            both the head judge and secondary judge were both seated, and so on. The only time the sixth judge makes
            a ruling is when the head judge, the secondary judge, and the third, fourth, and fifth judges are seated
            at a game.

            VTES tournaments shall consist of a minimum of three rounds. After the preliminary two or

            players with the same number of Game Wins, the players' total accumulated Victory Points from the
            preliminary rounds are used as a tie-breaker. In the event that ties still exist, Tournament Points (see
            <a href="#H3-7-3-tournament-point-scoring">3.7.3. Tournament Point Scoring</a>) are used.
            Remaining ties for any of the top five rankings are resolved using any fair random method
            (<i>e.g.</i>, a coin toss or a die roll). The five highest-ranked players advance to the final round.

        </p>
        <p>
            When the round is over, the judge will notify all players. The game will end with the
            current minion action - if any -, or at the end of the current phase, if the notification didn't happen

            The judge will group players randomly and impartially, using prepared index cards, a
            computerized system for generating random groupings, or another impartial randomizing method. Regardless
            of the method used, the players are to be grouped randomly and impartially, without regard to the
            identities of the players behind the numbers (or cards or other method used to designate players in the
            system) and without regard to any personal relationship between the players or personal disposition of
            any player toward another. Use of the optimal seating chart, found in The Archon tournament tracking
            spreadsheet, is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
            The judge will randomly and impartially assign players in groups of five. In the event that
            the number of players is not evenly divisible by five, the judge will assign players in groups of four
            and five, such that as many groups as possible contain five players.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the players cannot be divided into groups of 4 and 5 (<i>i.e.</i>, there are 6, 7, or 11
            players), then the judge may elect to use a seating arrangement in which some players sit out each round
            (while still ensuring that every player plays the same number of games, usually equal to one less than
            the number of rounds).
        </p>
        <p>
            Each table has five positions, numbered one through five, arranged clockwise around the
            table. The first player assigned to a table occupies position one, and so on. When play begins for each
            round, the player in position one plays first (with a default of one transfer during the influence
            phase), and so on. At tables with only four players, the empty position for turn rotation is ignored.

        </p>
        <p>
            The judge must ensure that exact predator-prey relationships are not duplicated from round
            to round whenever possible. When this occurs, the judge will randomly and impartially rearrange the
            seating assignments of all players at the affected table. The judge may, at his or her discretion,
            reseat players who were assigned to table together during any previous round to different tables (doing
            so impartially).

        <p>
            Table positions are not assigned in the final round. Instead each of the finalists is given
            an index card (or reasonable substitute) with his or her name on it. Each finalist shuffles his or her
            crypt and presents it to the judge for additional shuffling and cutting, if desired. The judge then
            draws three random cards from each crypt and reveals them: those, as well as the number of cards left in
            the crypt and who they belong to, are public information until all the players are seated. Starting with
            the lowest qualifier, each qualifier places his or her index card faceup in a row on the table. When
            placing his or her card, each player must choose to position his or her card at either end of the row
            (one end of the row is equivalent to the other) or may create a space between two cards already placed.
            After all cards have been placed, they are read from left to right to determine seating positions in the
            final round. The judge will then determine randomly which player will play first. The revealed crypt
            cards are shuffled back into their owner's crypt.

            Players are prohibited from making modifications to their decks between rounds unless the
            tournament uses the following multi-deck rules. The multi-deck system can be used at any tournament that
            is neither a national championship, a grand prix, or a continental championship. Organizers choosing to
            use this system must announce its use in advance of the tournament date. Players may choose to bring any
            number of tournament-legal decks to the tournament and/or extra cards to exchange with cards in their
            decks (also known as a sideboard in some games). Between rounds, players may freely switch decks (or
            cards in their decks).

        <p>
            In a very small tournament, one with fewer than 8 players (<i>i.e.</i>, fewer than two
            tables), the organizer may choose to omit the final round altogether or may choose to run an additional
            "preliminary" round in place of the final. This decision must be made and announced to all the players
            prior to the start of the first round. With no final, the results of the preliminary rounds (including
            the additional preliminary round, if any) are used to determine final standings in the same manner as
            described in 3.1 above. The no-final rules can be used in conjunction with or without the multi-deck
            system above, at the organizer's option. A tournament begun under the no-final arrangement cannot admit
            more players between rounds if doing so would create a round with 8 or more players.

            The following steps must be performed in order before each game begins.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players shuffle their decks.</li>
            <li>Players present their decks to their predators for additional shuffling and cutting, if desired.

            <li>Each player draws seven cards from his or her library and four cards from his or her crypt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All shuffling must be done so that the faces of the cards cannot be seen. Regardless of the
            method used to shuffle, players' decks must be sufficiently randomized. Each time players shuffle their
            decks (before the game or during the game), they must present their decks to their predator for
            additional shuffling and/or cutting. At the judge's discretion, players may request to have a judge
            shuffle their cards rather than pass that duty to their predators. By presenting their decks to their
            predators, players state that their decks are sufficiently randomized.
        </p>
        <p>
            After decks are presented and accepted, players who do not consider their opponents' decks
            to be sufficiently randomized must notify a judge. The head judge has final authority regarding whether
            a deck has been sufficiently randomized.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once predators have the opportunity to shuffle and/or cut players' decks, the cards are
            returned to their original owners. If the predator has shuffled the player's deck, that player may make
            one final cut.

                Point awarded for withdrawal).

        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike the standard rules, however, a player receives only a half Victory Point for
            withdrawing, not the full Victory Point the normal rules award.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player receives a half Victory Point if he or she has not been ousted when the time limit
            is reached, marking the end of the round, unless that player is the last one surviving at the table, in
            which case (as indicated in the VTES game rules) the player receives a full Victory Point, as normal.

        </p>
        <p>
            With all the Victory Points recorded, players are then ranked at their table from first

            <strong>Example (five-player table):</strong> Players A and C ousted one prey each. Players B and D

            survived the round (along with A and C).

        <p>
            Therefore, Players A and C each receive one and one-half Victory Points - one Victory Point
            for ousting one prey, and one-half Victory Point for surviving the round. Player E receives one-half
            Victory Point for surviving the round. Players B and D receive no Victory Points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players A and C tie for first place (first and second) at the table, so each receives 54
            Tournament Points ([60 + 48] / 2 = 54). Since they are tied (and since neither scored at least 2 Victory
            Points), no Game Win is awarded. Player E is clearly in third place, and receives 36 Tournament Points.
            Players B and D tie for fourth (fourth and fifth) place, and each receives 18 Tournament Points ([24 +

            round.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, Player A receives one and one-half Victory Points - one Victory Point for ousting
            one prey, and one-half Victory Point for surviving the round. Player B receives no Victory Points, and
            Players C and D each receive one-half Victory Points for surviving the round.
        </p>
        <p>
            Player A finishes in first place at the table, and receives 60 Tournament Points. Players C
            and D tie for second (second and fourth, because third place at the table goes to the "table bye"), and
            each receive 36 Tournament Points ([48 + 24] / 2 = 36). Player B finishes in fifth place with 12

            As long as the game is not under production, the organizer of an event that is neither a
            National Championship nor a Continental Championship can choose to allow proxy cards in his or her
            event. For events where proxy cards are allowed, several points apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>there are no limit to the number of proxy cards a deck can have</li>
            <li>every proxy card must be a color-copy of the original card, on standard paper</li>
            <li>the quality of the print must allow the reading of the illustrator's name</li>
            <li>the organizer must mark the event as 'allowing proxy cards' on the VEKN calendar"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Proxy-cards must be inserted in an opaque sleeve (along the rest of the crypt and/or library),
            before a regular VTES card.
        </p>
        <p>
            Otherwise, the use of proxy cards is not permitted, unless a judge provides these cards. If
            a card becomes excessively worn through play or accidentally damaged in the current sanctioned
            tournament, or if the owner of the card must leave prior to the conclusion of a game, the judge may
            provide a proxy replacement card or (in the case of damaged or worn cards) require the player to sleeve
            all of his or her cards before play continues.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a judge creates a proxy for a player, it is included in the player's deck. The original
            card is kept close at hand during the game, if possible. When the proxy is in play, replace it with the
            original. When it returns to the player's deck/hand, swap it with the proxy. This replacement method
            helps ensure that the opponent is able to clearly see the intended card and to avoid confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term "proxy" includes counterfeit cards or any card that is not a genuine game card.
            Counterfeiters will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

        <p>
            Players may use plastic card sleeves or other protective devices on cards. If a player
            chooses to use card sleeves, all cards in the player's current deck must be placed in the sleeves in an
            identical manner. If the sleeves feature holograms or other markings, cards must be inserted into the
            sleeves so these markings appear uniformly on the cards (all markings on the face or all on the backs,
            but not mixed). A player may choose to sleeve his library but not his crypt, or vice-versa, and the
            crypt and the library may be sleeved differently from each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a game begins, players may request that the judge inspect an opponent's card sleeves.
            The judge may disallow a player's card sleeves if the judge believes they are marked, worn, or otherwise
            in a condition that interferes with shuffling or game play. To avoid confusion, a card sleeve may also
            be used to mark a player's card if the card is in an opponent's playing area.

            One aspect of sportsmanlike conduct is that players must not play toward goals that conflict
            with the goal of the game as stated in the VTES rulebook (<i>e.g.</i>, attacking certain players on the
            basis of their VEKN ratings or overall tournament standing, etc.). For tournaments, playing to win
            means playing to get a Game Win if it is reasonably possible, and when a Game Win is not reasonably
            possible, then playing to get as many Victory Points as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither the basic game rules nor the tournament rules enforce or regulate deals made between
            players. The tournament rules acknowledge deals, however, in that a deal which represents the best
            interests of the players involved at the time the deal is made is allowed to be honored, even when the
            normal play to win rule would indicate that a deal should be broken. This only applies to deal that are
            in the best interests of the players involved at the time the deal is made. That is, it applies only
            when making the deal is playing to win. (It is also allowable to break such a deal, of course).
        </p>
        <p>
            During the finals, playing to win means playing to finish as tournament winner (as defined
            in <a href="#H3-7-5-final-round-scoring">3.7.5. Final Round Scoring</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Exception:</strong> when only two Methuselahs remain, the tournament rules no longer
            acknowledge any deals. Prior deals are voided, even if they were play to win when made. When only two
            Methuselahs remain, both Methuselahs must play to win based only on game state, without regard to any
            deals.

            combat, and everything else. Note that game state includes all players' hands, ash heaps, and libraries,
            as well as available maneuvers and presses from cards in play, and master: out-of-turn plays.

            The head judge or tournament organizer may require players to register their decks upon
            arrival at a tournament. Registration records the original composition of each deck. Once a tournament
            official receives a player's decklist, the deck may not be altered. Failure to properly register a deck
            will result in the head judge applying the appropriate provisions of the
            <a href="{{ url_for('document_judges_guide') }}">Judge's Guide</a>. The
            VEKN recommends that organizers check a reasonable number of decks against their decklists each round.

            The minimum sizes for the library and the crypt in limited formats are determined by the
            number of boosters used per player. If any starters are used, the minimums are forty for the library and
            twelve for the crypt.
        </p>
        <p>
            If eight or more boosters are used per player, the library minimum is forty. Otherwise, the
            minimum for the library is five cards per booster, and see <a href="#H7-2-2-recursion">7.2.2. Recursion</a>
            below for the mechanism used to increase the effective size of the library.
        </p>
        <p>
            In all cases, the library cannot contain more than ninety cards.
            If twelve or more boosters are used per player, the crypt minimum is twelve. Otherwise, the
            minimum for the crypt is equal to the number of booster packs used per player.
        </p>
        <p>
            Crypts may contain cards from any groups without any limitations based on group numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The rules based on number of boosters assume that each booster pack has eleven cards.
            When using boosters from the sets that don't have eleven cards in each booster (<em>e.g.</em>, the
            original 1994 and 1995 base sets, or from the <em>Dark Sovereigns</em>, <em>Ancient Hearts</em>,
            or <em>The Sabbat</em> expansions), then calculate the effective number of 11-card-boosters by dividing the
            total number of cards by 11 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Use that number to find the minimum
            deck sizes (this section) and the number of recursions (next section).

        </h4>
        <p>
            When the minimum library size is less than forty, each player gets a number of recursions
            based on that minimum size. (The term recursion is based on the draft format which inspired it, the
            <em>Internal Recursion Draft</em> format, also known as <em>Swainbank Draft</em>).

        </p>
        <p>
            Each recursion allows the player to use a discard phase action to shuffle all the library
            cards in his or her ash heap back into his or her library. This can be done whether or not there are any
            cards left in the player's library or hand. A player is not considered to have exhausted his or her
            library if he or she has any recursions remaining (which means that a player cannot attempt to withdraw
            if he or she has any recursions left, for instance).
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of recursions is chosen to make the effective library size (the size of the
            library multiplied by the number of times the player goes through the library) as close to sixty as
            possible. The following table shows the number of recursions each player gets based on the number of
            booster packs used per player.

            Note that sixty is used for the effective library size rather than forty, because players
            will typically want to use recursion before their hands are empty, and because some library cards may be
            in play area or may have been removed from the game during play (and therefore not returned to the
            library by recursion).

            The head judge or tournament organizer may require players to record on a decklist every
            card they receive in a Limited tournament. Once the cards are registered, players have a limited amount
            of time to prepare their decks before play begins. The VEKN recommends that organizers check a
            reasonable number of decks against their decklists each round.

            All cards players use in Limited events must be received directly from tournament officials.
            Every player receives identical sealed product (same number and assortment of booster packs as every
            other player in the tournament), with the possible exception of preconstructed starter decks. If any
            preconstructed starter decks are used, they may be distributed randomly to the players. The organizer
            may require that players use the decks they are randomly given, or may allow the players to trade
            starters amongst themselves before opening any of the sealed product (starters or boosters).
        </p>
        <p>
            Optionally, the organizer may have the players bring their own sealed product, with whatever
            restriction to set(s) and/or number of boosters and/or starters from each set the organizer chooses.
            These restrictions must be advertised well in advance of the tournament. In these cases, the players
            won't necessarily have identical product.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players may use only the actual cards they receive or draft at a Limited tournament plus any
            additional cards specifically provided by the tournament organizer. Players may not trade or replace the
            cards they receive or draft at a Limited tournament with any other cards, even if the replacement is an
            exact copy. If a card is damaged or otherwise considered "marked," players must comply with the
            following section.

            Players who have an abnormal number of cards in the decks or booster packs they receive must
            inform the head judge, who may replace the deck or booster pack at his or her discretion. If a player
            receives a "marked" card (see <a href="#H5-4-marked-cards">5.4. Marked Cards</a>),
            the head judge may replace that card with a proxy card at his or her discretion.

            Once a player in a Limited tournament has received sealed product, he or she may not leave
            (withdraw from) the event prior to the conclusion of first round. If a player violates this rule, he or
            she must return the product he or she received from the organizer, and receives a "Loss" for the round
            on the official tournament record and is dropped from the tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
            Late arrivals can be added, if the organizer permits it. The added players receive product
            and build decks according to the sealed deck rules, even if the tournament is a draft. This is true even
            if there are multiple late arrivals. They can be added into the tournament in any round after they have
            completed the contstruction of their decks.

            A Standard Sealed Deck event may require participants to perform a sealed-deck swap. In a
            sealed deck swap, players do not play with the decks they originally receive at the event. Instead, the
            sealed product - as well as deck-registration sheets - are handed out to all players in the event.
            Players open their decks and record the contents on their deck-registration sheets. This process is
            called "registering a deck". A tournament official will then collect the sealed product and the
            corresponding deck-registration sheets. Next, 10 to 20 percent of the decks are handed back out to the
            players who registered them. The remainder of the decks are handed out randomly to all players who do
            not have a deck. It is perfectly acceptable for players to receive their original decks back at this
            point. This entire process is called a sealed-deck swap. Players will then construct decks from the
            product they have at this time.

        <p>
            The player trading first from the cards presented on the table is called the active player.
            The first active player is the participant in the first seat, designated by the judge. After each
            successful (accepted) trade, the player to the left of the active player becomes the active player.
        </p>
        <p>
            The active player offers a trade by selecting a faceup card in front of another player in
            the pod. The owner of the selected card may accept or decline the offer, with the following results:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Accept.</strong> The owner of the selected card selects a faceup card in front of the active
                player. The two selected cards are exchanged and placed facedown.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Decline.</strong> The owner of the selected card turns the selected card facedown where it is.
                The active player cannot select any other cards from the same player again this turn.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the active player has no faceup cards, or if all other players decline to trade with the
            active player, then his or her turn is over and the player to his or her left becomes the new active
            player.
        </p>
        <p>
            If only one player has any faceup cards, he or she turns them facedown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once all cards are facedown, the trading phase ends. The players then add two cards from
            their crypt sideboards to their crypts and shuffle their 15 trading stock cards into their libraries
            (bringing the libraries to 65 cards). Once all pods have finished the trading phase, regular tournament
            play begins.

            Players assemble randomly into drafting circles (called pods) of roughly equal size at the
            discretion of the tournament organizer or head judge. Pods may correspond to the Players' first round
            table assignments. A tournament official then distributes the booster packs to be drafted to each player
            in the pod.
        </p>
        <p>
            As players draft the cards, they must place their cards in two orderly piles in front of

            The organizer chooses the format for the draft (table draft, booster draft, etc.). The

            product in a "sealed deck" format rather than drafting it. For example, the organizer may specify that
            players will use preconstructed starters as sealed deck and then add cards from two booster packs (per
            player) drafted using booster draft rules.

            At a signal from a tournament official, each player opens the booster pack specified by the
            official and counts the cards. If a player does not have the appropriate number of cards in his or her
            booster pack, he or she must notify the judge immediately, who will replace the pack. The player chooses
            one card from the booster pack, then passes the remaining cards facedown to the player on his or her
            left. The opened packs are passed around the drafting pod - with each player taking one card each before
            passing - until all cards are drafted. Once a player has removed a card from the pack, it is considered
            selected and may not be returned to the pack.
        </p>
        <p>
            After each player's first pack is drafted, a tournament official will instruct players to
            open the next specified pack and draft in the same fashion, except that the direction of drafting is
            reversed. This process is repeated until all cards in all booster packs are drafted. For example, if
            five booster packs were being drafted, the first, third, and fifth pack would be drafted clockwise and
            the second and fourth pack would be drafted counterclockwise.

            Before the tournament begins, the head judge must announce how much time each player has to

            the "oldest" card still remaining from the booster pack.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> The pod players each lay out cards two cards from his or her booster pack.
            The cards can be considered to be in chronological order (1-10), where 1 is the first card placed on the
            table by the player who will draft first and 10 is the last card placed on the table by the player who
            will draft fifth. If a player fails to draft in a timely manner, the cards on the table are examined by
            the pod judge and the "oldest" card on the table (not yet drafted) is given to the player.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a Table Draft, players must always display the most recent card they drafted from the
            current set faceup. When all cards are drafted from the current set, players may move their cards from
            that pack to any position.

            player in the group selects two cards, instead of one, and the drafting continues in reverse order,
            moving back to the player who began the drafting (the first person who drafted from the set). After all
            cards are drafted (with each player having two cards from the current set), the table judge prepares for
            the next booster-pack draft.

            <strong>Example:</strong> Five players are seated around a table. They are numbered 1-2-3-4-5 in a

            (facedown) and moves the crypt cards to the top. Then each player places the top two cards from his or
            her booster faceup in the center of the table. After the twenty-second review period has expired, the
            draft order is as follows:

        <p>
            Player 1 - card 1<br> Player 2 - card 2<br> Player 3 - card 3<br> Player 4 - card 4<br>

            is complete, and then separating the crypt cards from the library cards (both facedown). If a player

            a row, the VEKN will investigate the organizer's reporting history and issue sanctioning penalties as
            appropriate.

        <ul>
            <li>
                The event coordinator outlines the qualification process and number of qualifying tournaments in a

            The VEKN produces stats-based ratings for the VTES tournament results grouped as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard Constructed</li>
            <li>Limited (all formats together in one group)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The VEKN maintains a rating for each registered player which provides an estimate of the player's
            experience in his or her most recent VEKN sanctioned tournaments. The VEKN maintains performance
            statistics for each player as well (number of games, GW, VP).
            See the <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">World Ranking</a> for the current ratings of prominent players.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Each player has a rating represented by a single number. This number is sometimes refered to as RtP (rating
            points).
        </p>
        <p>
            Players will be ranked according to their ratings (RtP) beginning with their first tournament. That is,
            there is no minimum number of events a player must attend before being ranked.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player will be removed from the rankings after 12 months of inactivity (no rated tournament rounds
            played), but the player's rating and other statistics will be kept indefinitely (to be used when and if the
            player plays again).

        <p>
            The ratings system is a points accumulation system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each player's rating is based only on sanctioned tournaments attending in the preceding 18 months. No more
            than 8 tournaments will count toward a player's rating. For players who play in more than 8 tournaments
            during a given 18 month period, only the 8 best tournament results for that player in that 18 month period
            are used.
        </p>
        <p>
            A players rating is the sum total of several values computed for each of the tournaments (up to 8
            tournaments) in which he or she plays, as described below. The most points are awarded to the players who
            finish first and second in the tournament, but all players accumulate points for games won, victory points
            achieved, and even for simply attending.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5 RtP</strong> for each tournament attended.</li>
            <li><strong>4 RtP</strong> for each VP (victory point) scored.</li>
            <li><strong>8 RtP</strong> for each game won (GW or final round victory).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>X RtP</strong> for finalists. X is computed based on the size (number of players) of the
                tournament and the final standing (winner or finalist) of the player. A higher bonus is awarded for
                making the finals of a Continental or National Championship than for other tournaments. See below for
                the actual computation.
            </li>

        <p>
            The finalists get additional ratings points (RtPs) computed as follows. A number based on the finishing
            (winner or finalist) is multiplied by a coefficient which is designed to factor in the level of
            competition. The coefficient is based on the number of players in the tournament and the type of tournament.
        </p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            (For a 15-player tournament, the coefficient is <span class="font-monospace">1</span>.
            More players mean a larger coefficient. Fewer players mean a smaller coefficient.)
        </p>
        <p>
            For a national championship, <span class="font-monospace">0.25 </span>is added to the coefficient.<br>
            For a continental championship, <span class="font-monospace">1.0</span> is added to the coefficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of points from the table above is multiplied by the coefficient to determine the number of
            additional ratings points awarded to the finalist. For example, in a qualifier with 50 players, the
            coefficient is
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>log<sub><small>15</small></sub>(2500) - 1 + 0.25 = 2.889 - 0.75 = 2.139</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            So the winner there gets a bonus of <span class="font-monospace">2.139 × 90 = 193</span> ratings points
            (plus normal points for winning the round and for each victory point scored).
