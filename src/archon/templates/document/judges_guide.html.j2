        <p>
            The VEKN Judges' Guidelines (formerly called 'Penalty Guidelines') provide a structure to help judges
            resolve play errors and determine the appropriate penalty for infractions that occur during the course of a
            tournament. Penalties exist to protect players from potential misconduct. All penalties in this document
            (with the exception of <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#H160-cheating">160 Cheating</a>)
            assume that the infraction is unintentional. If a judge believes that an infraction was intentional,
            the penalty should be upgraded as appropriate
            (see <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#H160-cheating">160 Cheating</a>).
            Please remember that these are only guidelines. If the judge believes that the situation has significant,
            extenuating circumstances, he or she is free to modify the penalty as appropriate.
        </p>

            <strong>Note:</strong> See

        <p>
            Infractions are listed in the following manner:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Infraction Type, Infraction Name - The category and designation of the infraction.</li>
            <li>Definition - The description of what qualifies as an infraction.</li>

                <i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>
            </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Caution:</strong> This is the smallest penalty that can be given. A caution is a verbal warning to a
            player. The caution must explain the infraction and the consequences if the infraction is repeated. A
            caution should be reported to the head judge, but does not need to be tracked on paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> A warning is an officially tracked penalty. The purpose of a warning is to alert
            judges and the players involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction
            in the VEKN Penalty Database. Warnings must be communicated to the head judge and the tournament official
            responsible for the permanent tracking of the warning. Warnings must also be communicated to the player,
            explaining the infraction as well as possible consequences if the infraction is repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Game Loss:</strong> A warning is always given with this penalty. If the player is between games, the
            loss should be applied to the player's next game. A Game Loss is recorded as a loss to all active players
            and tied with any other players who have a Game Loss. If the penaly occurs in the middle of a game, the
            judge should award pool and/or Victory Points to the player's Predator, or making other arrangements to
            preserve game balance for the remaining players, as warranted (possibly awarding partial VPs). Game losses
            must be communicated to the head judge and the tournament official responsible for the permanent tracking of
            the warning. Judges must communicate game losses to the player and explain the infraction and possible
            consequences if the infraction is repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Disqualification:</strong> A warning is always given with this penalty. When this penalty is
            applied, the player loses his or her current match and is dropped from the tournament. Players will still
            receive whatever prizes they have earned before the disqualification. In certain situations, a
            disqualification without prize is appropriate. A disqualification without prize is defined as a
            disqualification with the player receiving no prizes and receiving no additional awards (such as
            professional points, event invitations, and so on). Disqualification without prize is recommended for severe
            Unsportsmanlike conduct and cheating. Disqualifications must be communicated to the head judge and the
            tournament official responsible for the permanent tracking of the warning.
        </p>

            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#H30-applying-penalties"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Penalty Guidelines apply to every sanctioned event, but certain infractions may not apply to certain
            events. For example, events that do not use decklists will not use decklist-related penalties. If a decklist
            error is discovered during play, the penalty should be applied immediately. For example, if a player notices
            his or her opponent playing with a banned card, a penalty should be applied immediately. If players bring an
            infraction to the attention of the judge, a penalty should be applied for that infraction in the round in
            which it occurred, whenever possible.
        </p>
        <h3 id="H40-repeat-offenses">40. Repeat Offenses
            <a class="link-secondary" rel="bookmark" href="#H40-repeat-offenses"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The recommended penalty for the first offense is listed in the "Penalty" portion of each infraction. For the
            second offense of the same infraction, the next highest penalty is recommended. Note that this increase of
            penalty follows the order of:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <strong>Caution → Warning → Game Loss → Disqualification</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            If a baseline penalty is a warning, the second offense should receive a game loss, and the third offense
            should receive a Disqualification. For example, a player's penalty for the first offense of Card
            Drawing—Looking at Extra Cards would be a caution. The player's penalty for a second offense would be the
            next highest, which is a warning. His or her third offense would result in a game loss, and fourth offense
            would result in the player's disqualification. Disqualifications that are the result of accumulated
            infractions are not disqualifications without prize. At the judge's discretion, a level of penalty may be
            repeated before before escalating to the next level. For example, an inexperienced player has a habit of
            holding his cards below the table. After receiving a caution from the judge, the player later repeats the
            infraction. The judge may choose to issue an additional caution rather than escalating to a warning.

            This penalty applies to tournaments in which decklists are being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players are considered to have an illegal decklist when one of the following conditions is true:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The decklist contains an illegal number of cards.</li>
            <li>The decklist contains cards that are illegal for the format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>(A)</strong> A player in a Contructed tournament has 58 cards listed on his decklist when the
            minimum
            is 60.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>(B)</strong> A player in any tournament lists Madness of the Bard (a banned card) on his decklist.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The decklist is the ultimate guide to a player's deck. If the decklist lists an illegal deck, the player is
            playing with an illegal deck, regardless of the actual contents of his or her deck. However, it is not in
            the best interest of the event to disqualify players for illegal decklists.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Penalty:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Warning</strong>. The general philosophy is to correct a player's decklist so it is legal, and let
            the player continue playing. The head judge should correct the decklist to reflect the actual contents of
            the deck (if the main deck itself is legal). If the main deck is illegal both with the decklist and the
            physical main deck, the penalty is <strong>Game loss</strong>, and the head judge should allow the player
            five minutes to make the decklist legal and ensure the main deck matches the corrected decklist.

        <p>
            This penalty applies to tournaments in which decklists are being used. This penalty applies to players who
            have misplaced cards from their deck or have cards from a previous game in their deck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players are considered to have an illegal deck when one of the following conditions is true (while the
            decklist still indicates a legal deck):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The main deck contains an illegal number of cards.</li>
            <li>The main deck contains cards that are illegal for the format.</li>
            <li>The contents of the main deck do not match the decklist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The decklist is the ultimate guide to a player's deck. If the decklist indicates a legal deck, but the
            actual
            contents of the deck do not match the decklist, the player should restore the deck to reflect the decklist.
            If the judge can determine with complete confidence that the deck/decklist discrepancy is due to an error on
            the decklist (a player is using an all Gangrel deck and has Campground Hunting Ground listed on the decklist
            instead of Zoo Hunting Ground), he or she may decide to fix the decklist instead. A warning should be issued
            in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Penalty:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Game loss</strong>, and then be instructed to make any changes necessary to make the contents of the
            deck match what is recorded on the decklist. The changes must be complete before the next round begins for
            the player to continue in the tournament.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the deck contains an illegal selection of cards in some manner, the player is playing with an illegal
            deck. However, it is not in the best interest of the event to disqualify players for illegal decks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Penalty:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Game loss</strong>. Judges and other tournament officials must be vigilant about reminding players
            before the tournament begins of the consequences of playing with an illegal deck.
        </p>
        <p>
            When decklists are not being used, the general philosophy is to correct a player's deck and allow the player
            to continue playing in subsequent rounds. The head judge should work with the player to correct the deck.
            All illegal cards should be removed immediately. If cards need to be added to make the deck legal, the judge
            should require the player add only simple cards like Master Discipline cards and Forced Awakening, etc. -
            not specific counter cards like Gangrel Atavism, for example. If cards need to be removed to make the deck
            legal, then random cards should be removed in order to make the deck legal.

        <p>
            Players are not considered to have drawn extra cards when they place a card face down on the table (without
            looking at the card) in an effort to accurately count out cards as they draw. This penalty should be applied
            only once to one or more cards if they are drawn in the same action or sequence of actions, at the judge's
            discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Any time players draw extra cards, there is always a chance they will go unnoticed by their opponent,
            potentially giving them a significant advantage. Because of this potential for abuse, the penalty for
            drawing extra cards is fairly severe. A player can accidentally look at extra cards very easily, so a
            separate, less severe penalty is established for that infraction called Looking at Extra Cards (section
            122).
        </p>
        <p>
            Correcting the problem always involves putting the extra card (if known, or a random card from the player's
            hand if not known) back in the deck and reshuffling the deck, unless some other player has, through the
            course of the game, gained a knowledge of some portion of the player's deck, in which case the card should
            simply be returned to the top of the deck without shuffling. This ensures that the game will be impacted as
            little as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Improper Drawing at Start of Game (section 123) is also a separate, less severe penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Penalty:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Warning</strong>. For the game to continue, the situation should always be corrected. When it is
            obvious which extra card was drawn, the card should be placed back in the deck. If it is unclear which card
            is the "extra" card, a random card should be selected from a player's hand. The opponents of the player
            committing the infraction should be allowed to see any cards the other player has seen due to this
            infraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            An automatic <strong>game loss</strong> should be applied if a player has drawn so many cards that a judge
            is
            unable to correct the situation.

            This could include dropping cards on the floor, turning a card over while shuffling an opponent's deck, or
            revealing cards from their deck in the act of misplaying a card. This penalty also applies when a player has
            looked at a card in an opponent's deck or hand in the course of a game (such as turning over an extra card
            while resolving a random discard effect).

            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>

        <p>
            A player can accidentally look at extra cards very easily so the penalty is less severe than Drawing Extra
            Cards. Drawing Extra Cards is a separate, more severe penalty because of the increased potential for abuse.
            The card seen should be shuffled back into the deck or placed on top of the deck as appropriate (see 121) if
            it was the top card of the deck that was seen, or returned to the area where it came from otherwise.

        </p>
        <p>
            An automatic <strong>game loss</strong> should be applied if a player has seen so many cards that a judge is
            unable to correct the situation or has received too much of an advantage by seeing an extra card (for
            example, the player sees the next card which reveals some crucial, strategic information).

            <strong>Philosophy</strong>

        <p>
            This is generally a minor infraction and deserves a fairly minor penalty. Forcing players to redraw their
            hands with one less card is fairly quick and simple and avoids the possibility of a player gaining an
            advantage if he or she just had to reshuffle his or her cards and draw a new hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Penalty:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The player must shuffle his or her hand into the deck and redraw the opening hand, drawing one less card
            than
            the number he or she should have drawn - not the number he or she actually drew. His or her hand size should
            be restored to the normal amount after every player has taken a turn. If the error was in drawing too many
            crypt cards for the uncontrolled region (and looking at them), the reduced draw (of three uncontrolled
            vampires) is corrected by drawing the fourth vampire from the crypt after every player has taken a turn.

            The potential for advantage is high when there is a pattern to the markings. Therefore the penalty must be
            significant. Please note this penalty still assumes that the cards are marked unintentionally. Refer to
            section 160 - Cheating, if the judge believes that the cards were marked intentionally.

            Players who take longer than is reasonably required to complete game actions are engaged in slow play. If a
            judge believes that a player is intentionally playing slowly to take advantage of a time limit, that player
            is guilty of Stalling (section 162).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>(A)</strong> A player is unsure of with which minion to block, and spends five minutes trying to
            decide.

        <p>
            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Slow Play penalties do not require a judge to determine whether a player is intentionally stalling. All
            players have the responsibility to play quickly enough so their opponent is not at a significant
            disadvantage because of the time limit. A judge should take into consideration the tournament scores when
            deciding if this should be upgraded to a Stalling penalty.

        <p>
            <strong>Caution</strong>. In addition to the penalty, the judge may assign extra time to the game if he or
            she feels it is appropriate. The option to add extra time should be used sparingly in order to avoid
            tournament delays.

            If it is clear that a player is stalling, he or she should face a serious penalty. A player need not be
            playing slowly to be guilty of stalling. If the player is just performing idle activity for no purpose other
            than to take advantage of a time limit, this can also be considered stalling (e.g. using Vast Wealth on
            every turn even when no more equipment can be found just to spend time "searching" the library and shuffling
            it.) In addition to issuing any appropriate penalties to the stalling player, the judge may add an
            appropriate amount of time to the round to compensate for time lost due to stalling. The time added should
            not be more than the approximate amount of time lost due to the stalling violation. Any time added to the

            This section generally deals with returning the game to a fair and playable state after certain types of
            infractions. Only the judge may make corrections to the game state. Correction of the game state is done in
            addition to and not instead of the application of the appropriate penalty for the infraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Philosophy:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important that the player committing the infraction receive no benefit in the game for doing so. If no
            significant game actions have taken place, play should be backed-up to the point of the error. The error
            should then be corrected and the game should proceed forward from that point. If significant game actions
            have taken place (such as having too many cards played and/or replaced), the judge may choose to leave the
            game undisturbed or may adjust the game state in some other way (for instance, altering pool or blood
            levels) since players have made play decisions based on the subsequent state of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>(A)</strong> During his master phase, a player realizes he did not make the decision to pay for a
            contested card.;
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i>Resolution: </i></strong>In this case, very little has transpired since the error was made. The
            player backs up to his untap phase, chooses to pay or give up the contest, then continues his turn. Once the
            turn continues he may choose to make the same or different plays continuing forward from this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>(B)</strong> At the end of a lengthy turn involving several complex combats, a player realizes he
            did
            not make the decision to pay for a contested card.;
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i>Resolution: </i></strong>In this case, too much has transpired since the error and it would not
            be
            possible to rewind play to that point. In this instance, the judge decides to have the player immediately
            make his choice of whether or not to pay for the contested card, and then have play continue from the point
            where the error was realized.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>(C)</strong> Several turns after the occurrence, the players realize that a player had a vampire
            burned in combat from a strike card that the other player could not have legally played.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i>Resolution: </i></strong>In this instance, too much has transpired and no easy way to rewind play
            presents itself. The judge returns the burned vampire from the affected player's ash heap to the ready
            region with 1 blood. The affected player would have had the vampire during his prior two turns so the judge
            puts two blood on the vampire to simulate the gain from two successful hunt actions. Play resumes from the
            point where the players realized the error.

        <ul>
            <li>For 5-Player table, change the table to a four-player table.</li>
            <li>For 4-Player table, re-distribute players to new tables to create legal table sizes.</li>

            The judge <strong>must</strong> take care that the changed seating arrangements conform to the
            <a href="/document/tournament_rules.html#H3-1-2-preliminary-rounds-seating">

        <p>
            If the dropout causes the event to have to have an invalid number of players, the event becomes
            unsanctioned.
            Between rounds, modifications can be made (judge can play, etc.) to maintain sanctioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the drop occurs before the start of the first round and the event becomes unsanctioned due to not being
            able to generate legal table sizes, White Wolf prize support should not be distributed at the event. Events
            that become unsanctioned due to drops occurring during the event may still distribute prize support as
            normal. Submit the Archon or event report as normal, indicating in the notes what transpired at the event.
            The unsanctioned event will not count toward player ratings.

            <strong>Resolution</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Modify round times to accomodate venue concerns. Event becomes unsanctioned if any round time limit is less
            than 2 hours in duration and any game ends due to the time limit. If a round with a time limit of less than
            2 hours is completed without any tables going to time, the event will retain sanctioning. Note venue
            problems in event report. Distribute prize support as normal if you are able to complete the event.
